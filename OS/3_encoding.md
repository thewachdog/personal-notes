## Encoding :

* Process of converting data from one format to another format (eg : binary to decimal)

* It is NOT encryption

* Primarily used for efficient data storage, data transfer

* ''We know everything is stored in a computer as a binary value, which are of course only numbers. So if thatâ€™s the case, how do we work with letters and symbols? The answer is encoding.''

## ASCII:

* ASCII stands for 'American Standard Code for Information Interchange'

* Maps numerical values(bin,decimal,hex) to numbers and symbols (keyboard characters)

* It all depends on how the binary value stored in computer is interpreted (it maybe converted into hex, ascii, etc)

* Now Unicode standard is used
