# Linux 

- Linux borrows heavily from the UNIX operating system, with which its creators were well-versed.

- Linux accesses many features and services through files and file-like objects.

- Linux is a fully multi-tasking, multi-user operating system, with built-in networking and service processes known as daemons.

- Linux is developed by a loose confederation of developers from all over the world, collaborating over the Internet, with Linus Torvalds at the head. Technical skill and a desire to contribute are the only qualifications for participating.

- The Linux community is a far reaching ecosystem of developers, vendors, and users that supports and advances the Linux operating system.

- Some of the common terms used in Linux are: kernel, distribution, boot loader, service, filesystem, X Window system, desktop  environment, and command line.

- A full Linux distribution consists of the kernel plus a number of other software tools for file-related operations, user management, and software package management.
