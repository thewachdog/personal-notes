# Cybersec career :


### Offensive security:

Largest area in cybersec

Includes attackin applications, find vulns, etc

This is for me if i:
- enjoy how things work
- am analytical (likes collectin analyzin info , make decisions nd solves prob)
- thinks out of the box

Most common job here is penetration tester (a person who legally employed by an organisation to find vulns in their products)

Penetration tester needs more knowledge including:
- web app sec
- network sec
- use of prog lang (to write scripts in various lang)

Cloud sec is bein trend (coz organisations started shifting their infrastructure to cloud providers [aws, azure, etc])

We can specilaze in one of the topics , but we need to have broad knowledge in this

### Defensive Security:

Second major area within cyber sec

Involves detecting and stopping attacks of vulns and misconfigurations within technologies

Its for me if i:
- am analytical
- enjoys problem solving

One of the career is security analyst (his job is to monitor systems and detect whether any of these systems are attacked)

Another job is incident responder (their work starts once an attack is started. Their job is to find what did the attacker has taken in the organisation and what will be the impact of the attack [they also need to know how the things work and what attack can be carried against them] then they analyze the traces left by the attacker)

We need to learn malware analysis for defensive sec very useful (to analyze the malware used by the attacker, identify the malware action , prevent further attacks, etc)
