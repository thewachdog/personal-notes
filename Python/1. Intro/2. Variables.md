**Syntax for variable:**

`<variable name> = <value>`

Variable assignment is from left to right(i.e. use `a=5`. We cant use `5=a`)

Variable types:

```python
# Integer
a = 2
print(a)
#Output: 2

#Integer 
b = 9223372036854775807
print(b)
#Output: 9223372036854775807

#Floating point
pi = 3.14
print(pi)
#Output: 3.14

#String
c = 'A'
print(c)
#Output: A

#String 
name = 'John Doe'
print(name)
#Output: John Doe

#Boolean 
q = True
print(q)
#Output: True

#Empty value or null data type
x = None
print(x)
#Output: None
```

#### Rules for variable naming:

1. Variables names must start with a letter or an underscore.
2.  The remainder of your variable name may consist of letters, numbers and underscores.
3. Names are case sensitive.
4. We can't use python keywords as variable name


Nama data type eh variable ku assign panla na kooda python thaana endha data type adukku most a set agurdho adha variableku assign pannum

We can assign multiple values to multiple variabes at a same time
```python
a, b, c = 1, 2, 3
print(a, b, c)
#Output: 1 2 3
```


Protip: If variables is less than values, use _ as a variable name
```python
a, b, _ = 1, 2, 3
print(a, b)
# Output: 1, 2
```


When using such cascading assignment, it is important to note that all three variables a, b and c refer to the same
object in memory, an int object with the value of 1. In other words, a, b and c are three different names given to the
same int object
Assign same values to different variables
```python
a = b = c = 1 # all three names a, b and c refer to same int object with value 1
print(a, b, c)
# Output: 1 1 1
b = 2 # b now refers to another int object, one with a value of 2
print(a, b, c)
# Output: 1 2 1 # so output is as expected.
```
The above is also true for mutable types (like list, dict, etc.) just as it is true for immutable types (like int, string,
tuple, etc.

#### Modifying objects

If we modify value which are assigned to many variables at same time,  all variable values will change at same timeðŸ˜¬. 
```python
x = y = [7, 8, 9] # x and y are two different names for the same list object just created, [7, 8, 9]
x[0] = 13 # we are updating the value of the list [7, 8, 9] through one of its names, x in this case
print(y) # printing the value of the list using its other name
# Output: [13, 8, 9] # hence, naturally the change is reflected
```

We can create nested objects
```python
x = [1, 2, [3, 4, 5], 6, 7] # this is nested list
print x[2]
# Output: [3, 4, 5]
print x[2][1]
# Output: 4
```

Variables in Python do not have to stay the same type as which they were first defined
```python
a = 2
print(a)
# Output: 2
a = "New value"
print(a)
# Output: New value
```
