- To get input from the user, use the `input` function

(note: in Python 2.x, the function is called raw_input instead)

- _*Security Remark:*_ Do not use input() in Python2 - the entered text will be evaluated as if it were a Python expression (equivalent to eval(input()) in Python3), which might easily become a vulnerability. See [this article](https://medium.com/@GallegoDor/python-exploitation-1-input-ac10d3f4491f#.cr6w4z7q8) for further information on the risks of using this function.

- Note that the input is always of type `str`, which is important if you want the user to enter numbers. 
- Therefore, you need to convert the str before trying to use it as a number

```python
x = input("Write a number:")
# Out: Write a number: 10
x / 2
# Out: TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for /: 'str' and 'int'
float(x) / 2
# Out: 5.0
```

- NB: It's recommended to use try/except blocks to catch exceptions when dealing with user inputs. 
- For instance, if your code wants to cast a raw_input into an int, and what the user writes is uncastable, it raises a ValueError.
