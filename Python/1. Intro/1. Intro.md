# Introduction

* Python is high level lang created by Guido van rossum in 1991

* Python features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management and supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative, functional programming, and procedural styles. It has a large and comprehensive standard library.

* 2 version of python are currently in use: <br> Python2 (depreceated) and <br> Python3
 
* Type `python --version` in terminal to verify python is installed in linux

* **IDLE** is simple editor preinstalled with python

* Type `print("hello world")` in idle shell to run program

* To run python3 print function in python2: <br> from __future__ import print_function

* Type `python` to run python2 in terminal and ype `python3` to run python3 in terminal

* Close python shell: <br> Use `exit()` or `quit()` or **ctrl d** to exit

* Use **ctrl c** to stop a running program explictly

#### Online shells

#### Run commands as a string

* `$ python -c 'print("Hello, World")'` <br> `Hello, World`

- *pip* is used to install packages in python
- To install package using pip: <br> `pip install <package name>`

- **Shells** - So far, we have discussed different ways to run code using Python's native interactive shell. Shells use Python's interpretive power for experimenting with code real-time. Alternative shells include <br>
**IDLE** - a pre-bundled GUI, <br>
**IPython** - known for extending the interactive experience, <br>
and many more.

- *Programs* - For long-term storage you can save content to .py files and edit/execute them as scripts or programs with external tools e.g. shell, IDEs (such as *PyCharm*), *Jupyter notebooks*, etc. Intermediate users may use these tools; however, the methods discussed here are sufficient for getting started.

- [Python tutor](https://pythontutor.com/visualize.html#mode=edit) allows you to step through Python code so you can visualize how the program will flow, and helps you
to understand where your program went wrong.

- **PEP8** defines guidelines for formatting Python code. Formatting code well is important so you can quickly read what
the code does.
