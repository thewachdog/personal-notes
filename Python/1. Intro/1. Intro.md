Python is high level lang created by Guido van rossum in 1991

Python features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management
and supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative, functional programming,
and procedural styles. It has a large and comprehensive standard library.

2 version of python are currently in use:
Python2
Python3

Type `python --version` in terminal to verify python is installed in linux

**IDLE** is simple editor preinstalled with python

type `print("hello world")` in idle shell to run program

To run python3 print function in python2:
from __future__ import print_function

Type `python` to run python2 in terminal,
Type `python3` to run python3 in terminal

Close python shell:
Use `exit()` or `quit()` or **ctrl d** to exit

Use **ctrl c** to stop a running program explictly


#### Online shells

#### Run commands as a string

`$ python -c 'print("Hello, World")'
Hello, World`

*pip* is used to install packages in python
To install package using pip:
`pip install <package name>`

**Shells** - So far, we have discussed different ways to run code using Python's native interactive shell. Shells use Python's interpretive power for experimenting with code real-time. Alternative shells include 
**IDLE** - a pre-bundled
GUI, 
**IPython** - known for extending the interactive experience, etc.

*Programs* - For long-term storage you can save content to .py files and edit/execute them as scripts or programs
with external tools e.g. shell, IDEs (such as *PyCharm*), *Jupyter notebooks*, etc. Intermediate users may use these
tools; however, the methods discussed here are sufficient for getting started.

[Python tutor](https://pythontutor.com/visualize.html#mode=edit) allows you to step through Python code so you can visualize how the program will flow, and helps you
to understand where your program went wrong.

**PEP8** defines guidelines for formatting Python code. Formatting code well is important so you can quickly read what
the code does.
