#### What is AI?
Ai is creation of software that imitates human behaviour and capabilities.
It includes:
 - Machine Learning : foundation for AI system, and is the way we teach a computer model to.make prediction
- Anomaly detection : capability to automatically detect errors or unusual activity
- Computer vision : capability of software to interpret the world visually (camera , video , images , etc)
- Natural Language Processing : capability for a computer to interpret written or spoken lang and respond to.it
- Conversational AI : the capability of a software agent to participate in  a comversation

#### How ML works ?
We all generate huuuuugge amount of data . Data sointist use all of this data to train their model that make predictions based on relationships. (Eg : find species of flower using phone app
- team of botanits and sointists collect data on wild flower
- team labels the samples with correct species
- labelled data is processed using algorithm to find relationship between lables and samoles
- results are encapulated in a model
- if new samples are found , model can identify correct species label
)

#### Anomaly detection
Imagine you're creating a software system to monitor credit card transactions and detect unusual usage patterns that might indicate fraud. Or an application that tracks activity in an automated production line and identifies failures. Or a racing car telemetry system that uses sensors to proactively warn engineers about potential mechanical failures before they happen.

These kinds of scenario can be addressed by using anomaly detection - a machine learning based technique that analyzes data over time and identifies unusual changes.
