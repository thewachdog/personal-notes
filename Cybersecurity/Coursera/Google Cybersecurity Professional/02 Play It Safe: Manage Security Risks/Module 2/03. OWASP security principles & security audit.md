- OWASP - Open Web Application Security Project
#### OWASP principles
  - **Minimize attack surface area**: Attack surface refers to all the potential vulnerabilities a threat actor could exploit.
  - **Principle of least privilege**: Users have the least amount of access required to perform their everyday tasks.
  - **Defense in depth**: Organizations should have varying security controls that mitigate risks and threats.
  - **Separation of duties**: Critical actions should rely on multiple people, each of whom follow the principle of least privilege. 
  - **Keep security simple**: Avoid unnecessarily complicated solutions. Complexity makes security difficult. 
  - **Fix security issues correctly**: When security incidents occur, identify the root cause, contain the impact, identify vulnerabilities, and conduct tests to ensure that remediation is successful.

#### Additional OWASP security principles

- Establish secure defaults
- Fail securely
- Donâ€™t trust services
