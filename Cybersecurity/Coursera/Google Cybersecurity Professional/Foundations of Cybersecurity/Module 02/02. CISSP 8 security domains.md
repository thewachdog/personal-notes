CISSP defined 8 security domains for the organizations. They are:
1. Security and risk management
2. Asset security
3. Security architecture and engineering
4. Communications and network security
5. Identity and access management
6. Security assessment and testing
7. Security operations
8. Software development security

- we should have the basic idea about all the domains so that we can understand whom will work where
<br><br>

1. Security and risk management: (social engg, supply chain attacks)
- focuses on defining security goals and objectives, risk mitigation, compliance, business continuity, and the law

2. Asset security: (physical attacks)
-  focuses on securing digital and physical assets
- It's also related to the storage, maintenance, retention, and destruction of data

3. Security architecture and engineering: (supply chain attacks)
- optimizing data security by ensuring effective tools, systems, and processes are in place

4. Communications and network security: (password attacks, adversial ai, cryptography)
- focuses on managing and securing physical networks and wireless communications

5. Identity and access management: (adversial ai)
-  focuses on keeping data secure, by ensuring users follow established policies to control and manage physical assets, like office spaces, and logical assets, such as networks and applications

6. Security assessment and testing: (security analyst, penetration tester)
- focuses on conducting security control testing, collecting and analyzing data, and conducting security audits to monitor for risks, threats, and vulnerabilities.

7. Security operations: (digital forensics and incident response {dfir}, supply chain attacks)
- focuses on conducting investigations and implementing preventative measures

8. Software development security: (purple hat / secure coding)
- focuses on using secure coding practices, which are a set of recommended guidelines that are used to create secure applications and services
