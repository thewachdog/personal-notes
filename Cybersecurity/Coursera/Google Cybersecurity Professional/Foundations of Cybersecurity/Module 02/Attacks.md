Computer Virus:
-  malicious code written to interfere with computer operations and cause damage to data and software

Malware:
- software designed to harm devices or networks

Two early viruses:
1. Brain Virus (1986)
  - used to find people who uses pirated medical software and disable it but (unintentionally) it crashes the whole disk and spreads to other computers
2. Morris worm (1988)
  - created to find the number of users using internet at that time by installing on pc but it keeps on installing same pc causing the disk to crash

Social Engineering:
- a manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access, or valuables.

Phising:
- the use of digital communications to trick people into revealing sensitive data or deploying malicious software

Digital age attacks:
1. Love Letter (2000)
  - sends email saying love letter but stealthily scans user address books and send similar mails to them
  - one of the most early attack of social engineering
2. Equifax breach: (2017)
  - one of the biggest data breach of sensitive information
  - due to multiple vulnerabilities
  - company failed to take action needed to fix multiple known vulnerabilites (lazy like me? idk)
  - paid $575m to US govt for not mainting customer data efficiently and data loss, etc

Phishing:
- use of digital communications to trick people into revealing sensitive data or deploying malicious software
- common types of phishing attacks:
  - Business Email Compromise (BEC): A threat actor sends an email message that seems to be from a known source
  - Spear phishing: A malicious email attack that targets a specific user or group of users
  - Whaling: A form of spear phishing. Threat actors target company executives
  - Vishing: The exploitation of electronic voice communication to obtain sensitive information
  - Smishing: The use of text messages to trick users

Malware:
- software designed to harm devices or networks.
- The primary purpose of malware is to obtain money, or an intelligence advantage that can be used against a person, an organization, or a territory.
- most common types of malware:
  - Viruses:
    -  Malicious code written to interfere with computer operations and cause damage to data and software.
    -  needs to be initiated by a user.
    -  When someone opens the malicious attachment or download, the virus hides itself in other files in the now infected system.
    -  When the infected files are opened, it allows the virus to insert its own code to damage and/or destroy data in the system.
  -  Worms:
    -  Malware that can duplicate and spread itself across systems on its own
    -  it self-replicates and spreads from an already infected computer to other devices on the same network.
  -  Ransomware:
    -  A malicious attack where threat actors encrypt an organization's data and demand payment to restore access.
  -  Spyware:
    -  Malware that’s used to gather and sell information without consent.
    -  Spyware can be used to access devices.
    -  This allows threat actors to collect personal data, such as private emails, texts, voice and image recordings, and locations.

Social Engineering:
- Social engineering is a manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access, or valuables.
- Human error is usually a result of trusting someone without question.
- common types of social engineering:
  - Social media phishing: A threat actor collects detailed information about their target from social media sites
  - Watering hole attack: A threat actor attacks a website frequently visited by a specific group of users
  - USB baiting: A threat actor strategically leaves a malware USB stick for an employee to find and install, to unknowingly infect a network
  - Physical social engineering: A threat actor impersonates an employee, customer, or vendor to obtain unauthorized access to a physical location

Reasons why social engineering attacks are effective:
- Authority: Threat actors impersonate individuals with power. This is because people, in general, have been conditioned to respect and follow authority figures.
- Intimidation: Threat actors use bullying tactics. This includes persuading and intimidating victims into doing what they’re told.
- Consensus/Social proof: Because people sometimes do things that they believe many others are doing, threat actors use others’ trust to pretend they are legitimate. For example, a threat actor might try to gain access to private data by telling an employee that other people at the company have given them access to that data in the past.
- Scarcity: A tactic used to imply that goods or services are in limited supply.
- Familiarity: Threat actors establish a fake emotional connection with users that can be exploited.
- Trust: Threat actors establish an emotional relationship with users that can be exploited over time. They use this relationship to develop trust and gain personal information.
- Urgency: A threat actor persuades others to respond quickly and without questioning.
