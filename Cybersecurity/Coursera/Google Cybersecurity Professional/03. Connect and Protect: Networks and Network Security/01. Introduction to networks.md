network
- group of connected devices

devices can connect in two types of networks: LAN ana WAN

LAN
- spans a small area like an office building, a school, or a home

WAN
- spans a large geographical area like a city, state, or country

a useful skill to have is network traffic analysis

Hub
- a network device that broadcasts information to every device on the network

switch
- makes connections between specific devices on a network by sending and receiving data between them
- it is more intelligent than hub cozit only passes data to the intended destination

router
- network device that connects multiple networks together

modem
- device that connects your router to the internet, and brings internet access to the LAN

Virtualization tools 
- pieces of software that perform network operations
- carry out operations that would normally be completed by a hub, switch, router, or modem, and they are offered by Cloud service providers
- These tools provide opportunities for cost savings and scalability

wireless access point
- sends and receives digital signals over radio waves creating a wireless network
- Devices with wireless adapters connect to the access point using Wi-Fi

Cloud computing
- using remote servers, applications, and network services that are hosted on the internet instead of on local physical devices

cloud network
- collection of servers or computers that stores resources and data in a remote data center that can be accessed via the internet

cloud service provider (CSP)
- company that offers cloud computing services

CSPs provide three main categories of services:
- **Software as a service (SaaS)** refers to software suites operated by the CSP that a company can use remotely without hosting the software. 
- **Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)** refers to the use of virtual computer components offered by the CSP. These include virtual containers and storage that are configured remotely through the CSP’s API or web console. Cloud-compute and storage services can be used to operate existing applications and other technology workloads without significant modifications. Existing applications can be modified to take advantage of the availability, performance, and security features that are unique to cloud provider services.
- **Platform as a service (PaaS)** refers to tools that application developers can use to design custom applications for their company. Custom applications are designed and accessed in the cloud and used for a company’s specific business needs.

 Software-defined networks (SDNs) 
 - are made up of virtual network devices and services

Benefits of cloud computing and software-defined networks
- reliability
- decreased cost
- increased scalability
