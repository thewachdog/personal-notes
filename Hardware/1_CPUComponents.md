# Cpu components

### Motherboard:

* Older motherboard uses BIOS(Basic Input Output System) new motherboard uses UEFI(Unified Extensible Firmware Interface)
* BIOS and UEFI runs when computer is powered on to check whether all components and devices are connected properly...

### CPU(microprocessor):

* It is called as 'brain' of the computer.
* A single processor can process only ONE process at a time
* The number of instructions processed and the way computer defines priority of instructions makes CPU appesr like it can do many things at once

### RAMüêè:

* Faster than HDD and SSD
* Volatile(Data will lost when there is no power)
* OS will read from HDD and placed into RAM during booting(same procedure for all running programs)

### Storage:
* Example: HDD & SSD
* Non Volatile (data will stay even when the power goes down)
* Not to be confused with Memory(RAM)

### GPU(Graphics card):
* A chip dedicated to process graphics
* Not always present coz motherboard/cpu will process graphics using 'integrated graphics'ü•≤ü•≤
* Highly efficient for harder tasks
* Of course faster than integrated graphicsüòÇ
